Beaver's blog is a Jekyll theme curated for the community.<!--more--> It is the third iteration of a blog that was originally written in Vue and then rewritten in Jekyll twice.

## Goals

Something that feels like home â€“ Reflecting the design language we have come to love in Beaver.
Little to no JavaScript â€“ The less, the better. We tried to use as little JavaScript as possible.
Hassle-free for the reader â€“ Easy to navigate and content-focused.
RSS feed support â€“ For better cross-posting and reading experience.
Reusable and scalable â€“ Something you can use for your project.
Easy to maintain â€“ Writing articles is already time-consuming; why make it worse?
Easy to deploy â€“ Compatible with GitHub Pages.
Browser Support

This template works on most, if not all, modern browsers, including all Chromium-based browsers, Safari, and Firefox.
